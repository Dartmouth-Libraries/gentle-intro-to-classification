# Gentle Introduction to Classification

A gentle, low-code and low-math introduction to regression in the context of machine learning.

## Session description
In this session, we will discuss algorithms that associate an “observation” with a label. These so-called classifiers can be found all over the place: Spam detection, sentiment analysis, loan default prediction, facial recognition, and many more applications are all based on classifiers of some sort. You will gain an understanding of how a classifier “sees” an observation, how it arrives at a decision, and how we can gain insights into the decision making process.

It will be helpful, but not required, to attend the session on Gentle Introduction to Machine Learning: Statistics earlier in the term.

Complementing this session, there is also a workshop on Regressions, which highlights another main branch of machine learning techniques.
